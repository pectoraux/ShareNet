# ShareNet — Architecture Implementation Status

**Date:** 2026-08-18 (updated R2.2)
**HEAD:** see `git rev-parse HEAD`
**Status:** implementation progress, NOT production-ready

---

## N3-B Runtime

**NOT VERIFIED** until privileged external runtime test passes.

The TUN/transparent networking implementation exists but has not been
executed in a privileged Linux environment. The sandbox lacks:
- `/dev/net/tun`
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`
- `unshare` permission

## Layer Status Matrix

| Layer | Frozen Architecture | Current Implementation | Status | Evidence | Known Gaps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 Identity** | 4 identity classes, Ed25519+X25519, rotation, revocation | snp-identity: NodeIdentity + Capability (extracted R2.2) + NodeId + derive_node_id + verify_signed. snp-crypto: Ed25519+X25519 primitives. | PASS | Conformance vectors 03-identity: 7/7 pass. snp-node tests: 97 pass. | snp-identity crate is skeleton; identity logic in snp-node |
| **L2 Object/Content** | CAS, chunking, Merkle, manifests | TS reference: complete. Android: complete. Rust (snp-object): SKELETON (todo!). | PASS (TS+Android), MISSING (Rust) | Conformance vectors 04-chunking, 05-merkle, 06-manifest: all pass. | Rust crate is skeleton; TS is authoritative |
| **L3 Trust** | Attestations, reputation, revocation | AuthenticatedNodeRecord (complete). VerifiedNodeAdvertisement (complete). No reputation system. | PARTIAL | Conformance vectors 13-revocation: 3/3 pass. | Reputation system not yet implemented |
| **L4 Discovery** | Peer+capability advertisement, freshness | snp-discovery: SKELETON. snp-node: discovery.rs + peer_directory.rs + topology.rs (complete). GatewayAdvertisement carries mode capability. | PASS (logic), PARTIAL (crate) | snp-node integration tests: n210, n211, n213 pass. | snp-discovery crate is skeleton; logic in snp-node |
| **L5 Mesh Sync** | Anti-entropy, store-carry-forward, bundle custody | TS reference: complete (sync.ts, 2316 lines). Rust (snp-sync): SKELETON (all todo!). Not integrated with N3 runtime. | MISSING (Rust), PASS (TS) | TS sync.ts exports 30+ functions. | Not implemented in Rust; N3 bypasses this entirely |
| **L6 Routing** | Route discovery, metrics, selection, migration | snp-node: route.rs + route_engine.rs + route_discovery_protocol.rs (complete). Route, RouteHop, RouteState, signed descriptors. | PASS | Conformance vectors 10-routing: 4/4 pass. snp-node tests: n212, n2132 pass. | No drift |
| **L7 Gateway** | Egress, DNS, NAT, policy, quotas | snp-gateway: TransitRequest/Response (Mode A, complete). GatewayStreamTable (Mode B, complete, production SSRF). DNS interception (complete). | PASS | Conformance vectors 11-gateway: 19/19 pass. | No drift |
| **L8 Transport** | One-hop framing, platform-neutral | snp-link: AsyncLink+AuthenticatedLink (complete). snp-frames: Frame+TTL (complete). No imports from L6. | PASS | Conformance vectors 08-frames: 13/13 pass. | No drift — L8 remains platform-neutral |
| **L9 Virtual Network** | TUN, SOCKS5, store-forward, OS integration | TunClient (smoltcp+any_ip, SYN extraction, split-tunnel). N3AClient (SOCKS5). TCP-only, Linux-only. | PARTIAL | any_ip_verification: 5/5. transparent_tcp: 7/7. | NOT RUNTIME-VERIFIED. TCP-only, Linux-only, no UDP, no DNS-over-TUN |
| **L10 App Capability** | Catalog, apps, models, datasets | Android: complete. Not connected to new network architecture. | DEFERRED | Android app-feed tests pass. | Not yet integrated with the bearer |
| **L11 Civic** | Contribution proof, value function, verification | TS reference: complete (civic.ts 503 lines, receipts.ts 934 lines). Rust (snp-civic): SKELETON (all todo!). Conformance vectors: 5/5 pass. | MISSING (Rust), PASS (TS) | Conformance vectors 12-civic-points: 5/5 pass. | Rust civic is entirely skeleton |
| **L12 Settlement** | Authoritative points/wallet state | No implementation (Rust, TS, or Android). | MISSING | — | No authoritative settlement exists |

## Mode Ladder

| Mode | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Mode A** (delay-tolerant) | PASS (Rust+TS) | TransitRequest/Response in snp-gateway. `send_request_via_gateway_full_with_relay_async` in async_node.rs. |
| **Mode B** (proxied) | PASS (Rust) | MultiplexedCircuit, StreamHandle, serve_gateway_mode_b_multiplexed, N3AClient. |
| **Mode C** (transparent) | PARTIAL | TunClient with any_ip + destination extraction + split-tunnel. NOT RUNTIME-VERIFIED. TCP-only, Linux-only. |

---

## Traffic Class Split

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Class A (Content) | PASS (TS+Android) | Chunking, Merkle, manifests, CAS in TS/Android |
| Class B (Transit) | PASS (Rust) | TransitRequest, StreamMessage, encrypted circuit frames — relays cannot read payloads |
| Structural separation | PARTIAL | No explicit type-level enforcement. The split exists conceptually but is not enforced by a type boundary. |

---

## Production Composition (R1)

| Role | Production Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway | `snp-node gateway-prod` | PASS — uses `serve_gateway_mode_b_multiplexed` + `GatewayStreamTable::new()` |
| Relay | `snp-node relay-prod --config <path>` | PASS — uses `serve_relay_via_route` + signed advert config |
| Client | `snp-node client-prod --config <path> --dest-ip <IP> --dest-port <PORT>` | PASS — uses `MultiplexedCircuit::establish` + `open_stream` |
| TUN (Mode C) | `n3b_tun_demo mesh/tun` (snp-stack) | PARTIAL — separate composition, not runtime-verified |

All production commands generate fresh identity locally. No private keys
cross process boundaries. Route endpoints are authenticated via signed
advertisements.

## Invariants

1. ShareNet is a bearer, not an application.
2. Class A and Class B are structurally distinct (enforcement: PARTIAL).
3. Mode A/B/C are capability levels, not competing architectures.
4. L8 remains platform-neutral (verified: no L6 imports).
5. L9 is the only platform-specific networking layer.
6. Relays do not read Class B payloads (verified: I8 invariant enforced).
7. Gateway owns Internet egress policy (verified: GatewayStreamTable::new).
8. Civic points require verified contribution proofs (TS: complete; Rust: MISSING).
9. Client balances are never economic authority (not yet implemented).
10. Settlement is authoritative for Civic balances (not yet implemented).
11. Civic Points remain non-transferable until human review.
12. UI never claims a protocol capability that runtime evidence has not established (IS_MOCK=true).
